#+title: Org Syntax and Org Parsing

* Org Syntax
This section describes  the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html][Org syntax]] as it is  currently read by its
parser in [[file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/org-9.4/org-element.el::;;; org-element.el --- Parser for Org Syntax -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-][~org-element.el~]] and the export framework.

** The Four Context-Free Elements
"Context-free" means that  an element can be recognized  by looking at
its  line   alone,  or  at   one  or   two  lines  above   it.   The
following four elements are context-free:

- Headline :: can  contain a section

- Section :: contains  directly any  greater element  or element  and is
  usually contained  by a  headline, except that  the text  before the
  first headline belongs  to a section that is not  contained inside a
  headline.

- Planning lines ::

- Property drawers ::

Every other syntactical part exists within specific environments.

*** Headline
The form of a Headline is:
: STARS KEYWORD PRIORITY TITLE TAGS

A Headline contains directly one Section (optionally), followed by any
number  of deeper  level headlines.

- =STARS= ::  a string starting at  column 0, containing at  least one
  asterisk, and ended  by a space character.  The  number of asterisks
  is used to define the level of the headline.

- =KEYWORD= ::  a TODO  keyword (must  belong to  the list  defined in
  ~org-todo-keywords-1~).  Case is significant.

- =PRIORITY= :: a  priority cookie, which is a  single letter preceded
  by a hash sign # and enclosed within square brackets.

- =TITLE= :: made of any character but a new line, excluding all other
  elements.

  - =COMMENTED=    ::   If the  first word appearing  in the  title is
    "COMMENT" (case  significant), the headline will  be considered as
    "commented".

  - =Footnote   Section= ::   If its  title is  ~org-footnote-section~
    (case significant), it will be considered as a “footnote section”

- =TAGS= ::  colon-separate words, which can  contain any alphanumeric
  characters, underscores, at-sign, hash sign, or percent sign.

  - =ARCHIVED=   ::   If "ARCHIVE"  (case significant)  is one  of its
    tags, it will be considered as “archived”.

*** Section
A Section contains directly any Greater Element or Element.  A Section
is contained inside a Headline, or comes before the first Headline.

*** Planning Line

*** Property Drawer

** The Paragraph
A /paragraph/ is the basic unit  of measurement. If something does not
parse, then  it is  considered to  be a paragraph.  An /element/  is a
syntactical part that is at the  same level as a paragraph, i.e. which
cannot contain or be included in a paragraph.

** Environments
Environments fall into three categories:

1. *Object*:  a part that  can be included  in an element.

2.   *Element*:  a syntactical  part that  is at the  same level  as a
   paragraph; i.e.,  a part that  cannot contain  or be included  in a
   paragraph.

3.  *Greater  Element*:  a  syntactical part  that  can  contain  both
   elements and objects.

** Affiliated Keywords
Many element  types can  be assigned  *attributes* by  adding specific
keywords ("/affiliated keywords/") just  above the element considered.
The  next  section lists  those  elements  that /cannot/  be  assigned
attributes. All  others therefor can be.  "Affiliated keywords" follow
one of the following patterns:

#+begin_example
#+KEY: VALUE
#+KEY[OPTIONAL]: VALUE
#+ATTR_<BACKEND>: VALUE (multiple possible)
#+end_example

where =KEY= can be one of:

- =CAPTION= (multiple possible) (can contain objects)
- =CAPTION[OPTIONAL]=
- =HEADER= (multiple possible)
- =NAME=
- =PLOT=
- =RESULTS=
- =RESULTS[OPTIONAL]=


The parts =OPTIONAL= and =VALUE= can  contain any characters but a new
line.

*** Excluded Elements
The following elements /cannot/ be assigned attributes; every other
element, therefore, can.

- comment,
- clocks,
- headlines,
- inlinetasks,
- items,
- node properties,
- planning,
- property drawers,
- sections, and
- table rows,

** Greater Elements
Greater Elements  are "recursive element types."  Greater elements can
contain directly any other element or greater element except:
- elements of their own type,
- node properties, which can only be found in property drawers,
- items, which can only be found in plain lists.


The variable ~org-element-greater-elements~ contains  the complete list of
all Greater Elements.

#+caption:List of all Greater Elements
#+name: org-element-greater-elements-list
#+begin_src elisp :results list :exports both
(symbol-value 'org-element-greater-elements)
#+end_src

*** Greater Blocks
Greater Blocks follow the following pattern:

#+begin_example
#+BEGIN_NAME PARAMETERS
CONTENTS
#+END_NAME
#+end_example

=NAME= can be:
- =CENTER= : "center block"
- =QUOTE= : "quote block"
- =SPECIAL= : =NAME= is neither =CENTER=, =QUOTE=, nor a "block element"


=CONTENTS= can contain  any element. Lines beginning  with an asterisk
must be quoted by a comma.

*** Drawers including Property Drawers
Pattern for drawers is:

#+begin_example
:NAME:
CONTENTS
:END:
#+end_example

=CONTENTS= can contain any element but another drawer.

*** Dynamic Blocks
Pattern for dynamic blocks is:

#+begin_example
#+BEGIN: NAME PARAMETERS
CONTENTS
#+END:
#+end_example

=NAME= cannot contain white space.

=PARAMETERS= are optional.

*** Footnote Definitions
Pattern for footnote definitions is:

: [fn:LABEL] CONTENTS

Must start at column 0.

=LABEL= is either a number or a word.

=CONTENTS= can contain any element except another footnote definition.

*** Inlinetasks

*** Plain Lists and Items

**** Items
Pattern for items:

: BULLET COUNTER-SET CHECK-BOX TAG

Only =BULLET= is mandatory.

=BULLET= is one of (followed by whitespace):
- asterisk =*=
- hyphen =-=
- plus sign =+=
- =COUNTER= (number or letter) =1=, =A=
- =COUNTER)= (number or letter) =1)=, =A)=


=COUNTER-SET= follows the pattern:
: [@COUNTER]

=CHECK-BOX= is one of:
- =[ ]=
- =[X]=
- =[-]=


=TAG= follows “TAG-TEXT ::” pattern

**** Plain List
A "plain list" is a set  of consecutive items of the same indentation.
It can only directly contain items.

**** Ordered Plain List
If first item in  a plain list has a counter in  its bullet, the plain
list will be an “ordered plain-list”.

**** Descriptive List
If it contains a tag, it will be a “descriptive list”

**** Unordered List
Otherwise, it will be an “unordered list”.

*** Property Drawers
Property drawers  are a special  type of drawer  containing properties
attached to  a headline. They are  located right after a  headline and
its planning information.

Property drawers follow the following patterns:

#+begin_example
HEADLINE
PROPERTYDRAWER

HEADLINE
PLANNING
PROPERTYDRAWER
#+end_example

=PROPERTYDRAWER= follows the following pattern:

#+begin_example
:PROPERTIES:
CONTENTS
:END:
#+end_example

=CONTENTS= consists of zero or  more /node properties/, which can only
exist in property drawers.

=NODE PROPERTIES= follow the following patterns:

#+begin_example
:NAME: VALUE

:NAME+: VALUE

:NAME:

:NAME+:
#+end_example

=VALUE= can be anything but the newline character.

*** Tables
Tables start at lines beginning with either:
- a vertical bar =|= (has "org" type); or
- the =+-= string followed by plus or minus signs only (~table.el~ type)


=Org tables= end at the first line not starting with a vertical bar.

~Table.el~ tables  end at the  first line  not starting with  either a
vertical line or a plus sign.

An =org  table= can only contain  table rows. A ~table.el~  table does
not contain anything.

One or  more “#+TBLFM: FORMULAS”  lines, where “FORMULAS”  can contain
any character, can follow an org table.

** Elements

The variable ~org-element-all-elements~ contains  the complete list of
all elements.

#+caption: List of all elements
#+name: org-element-all-elements-list
#+begin_src elisp :results list :exports both
(symbol-value 'org-element-all-elements)
#+end_src

Elements  cannot contain  other elements.  The following  elements can
contain objects:
- keywords whose name belongs to ~org-element-document-properties~
- verse blocks
- paragraphs
- table rows

*** Babel Call
: #+CALL: VALUE

*** Blocks
#+begin_example
#+BEGIN_NAME DATA
CONTENTS
#+END_NAME
#+end_example

- =NAME= :: cannot contain whitespace

  - =COMMENT= :: creates a "comment block"

  - =EXAMPLE= :: creates an "example block"

  - =EXPORT= :: creates an "export block"

  - =SRC= :: creates a "source block"

  - =VERSE= :: creates a "verse block"

- =DATA= :: can contain any character but a new line. It is mandatory for a

  - =SOURCE= block ::
    : LANGUAGE SWITCHES ARGUMENTS

    - =LANGUAGE= cannot contain any whitespace
    - =SWITCHES= is made of any number of “SWITCH” patterns, separated
      by blank lines.
      - =SWITCH= pattern is either:
	- =-l FORMAT=
	- =-S= (single letter)
	- =+S= (single letter)
    - =ARGUMENTS= can contain any character but a new line.

  - =EXPORT= block ::
    : WORD (no white-space)

- =CONTENTS= ::  can contain  any character,  including new  lines. It
  will only be parsed if it is a =VERSE= block.

*** Clock---Diary Sexp---Planning

**** Clock
#+begin_example
CLOCK: INACTIVE-TIMESTAMP
CLOCK: INACTIVE-TIMESTAMP-RANGE DURATION
#+end_example

- =DURATION= :: =HH:MM=

**** Diary Sexp
For  more complex  date specifications,  Org mode  supports using  the
special  expression diary  entries implemented  in the  Emacs Calendar
package

A diary sexp is a line starting  at column 0 with =%%(= string. It can
then contain any character besides a new line.

: %%(

**** Planning
A planning is an element with the following pattern:

#+begin_example
HEADLINE
PLANNING
#+end_example
No blank line is allowed between =PLANNING= and =HEADLINE=.

and where =HEADLINE= is a /headline element/ and =fPLANNING= is a line
filled with =INFO= parts, where each of them follows the pattern:
: KEYWORD: TIMESTAMP

=KEYWORD= is either
  - “DEADLINE”,
  - “SCHEDULED” or
  - “CLOSED”


=TIMESTAMP= is a /timestamp object/.

*** Comment
A  /comment line/  starts  with zero  or  more whitespace  characters,
followed by a hash sign and a whitespace character or an end of line.

: #

*** Fixed Width Area
A /fixed-width line/ start with a  colon character and a whitespace or
an  end  of line.  /Fixed  width  areas/  can  contain any  number  of
consecutive /fixed-width lines/.

: :

*** Horizontal Rule
A /horizontal rule/ is a line made of at least 5 consecutive hyphens. It
can be indented.

: -----

*** Keywords
: #+KEY: VALUE

=KEY= can contain any non-whitespace character, but it cannot be equal
to =CALL= or any /[[*Affiliated Keywords][affiliated keyword]]/.

=VALUE= can contain any character excepted a new line.

#+begin_comment
If  =KEY= belongs  to  ~org-element-document-properties~, =VALUE=  can
contain objects.

NOTE: ~org-element-document-properties~ variable does not exist.
#+end_comment

*** LaTeX Environment

*** Node Properties

*** Paragraphs

*** Table Rows

** Objects
The variable  ~org-element-all-objects~ contains the complete  list of
all OBJECTS.

#+caption: List of all Objects
#+name: list-of-all-objects

Most  objects cannot  contain objects.  Objects  can be  found in  the
following locations only:

- affiliated keywords defined in ~org-element-parsed-keywords~,

  #+begin_src elisp :results list :exports both
  (symbol-value 'org-element-parsed-keywords)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  - CAPTION

- document properties,
- headline titles,
- inlinetask titles,
- item tags,
- paragraphs,
- table cells,
- table rows, which can only contain table cell objects,
- verse blocks.

*** Entities and LaTeX Fragments

**** Entity
An Entity follows the following pattern:
: \NAME POST

where =NAME= has a valid association in either:
- ~org-entities~  or
- ~org-entities-user~.


and where =POST= is:
- the end of line,
- “{}” string, or
- a non-alphabetical character

**** LaTeX Fragment
A LaTeX fragment can follow multiple patterns:

#+begin_example
\NAME BRACKETS
\(CONTENTS\)
\[CONTENTS\]
$$CONTENTS$$
PRE$CHAR$POST
PRE$BORDER1 BODY BORDER2$POST
#+end_example

where =NAME= must not have an association in either:
- ~org-entities~ or
- ~org-entities-user~


=BRACKETS= is optional, and is not separated from =NAME= with white
spaces.  It may contain any number of the following patterns:

#+begin_example
[CONTENTS1]
{CONTENTS2}
#+end_example

where =CONTENTS1= can contain any characters excepted
: “{” “}”, “[” “]” newline

and =CONTENTS2= can contain any character excepted
: “{”, “}” newline

=CONTENTS= can  contain any character  but cannot contain =\)=  in the
second template or =\]= in the third one.

=PRE= is either the beginning of line or a character different from =$=.

=CHAR= is a non-whitespace character different from
: ., ,, ?, ;, ' "

=POST= is any punctuation (including parentheses and quotes) or space
character, or the end of line.

=BORDER1= is a non-whitespace character different from
: ., ,, ; $

=BODY= can contain  any character excepted =$=, and may  not span over
more than 3 lines.

=BORDER2= is any non-whitespace character different from
: ,, . $

*** Export Snippets
The pattern for Export Snippets is:
: @@NAME:VALUE@@

*** Footnote References
There are four patterns for footnote references:

#+begin_example
[fn:LABEL]
[fn:LABEL:DEFINITION]	# ("inline footnote")
[fn::DEFINITION]	# ("anonynous footnote")
#+end_example

=LABEL= can contain any word constituent character, hyphens and
underscores.

=DEFINITION=  can contain  any character,  though opening  and closing
square brackets  must be  balanced in  it. It  can contain  any object
encountered in a paragraph, even other footnote references.

*** Inline Babel Calls and Source Blocks

**** Inline Babel Calls
#+begin_example
call_NAME(ARGUMENTS)
call_NAME[HEADER](ARGUMENTS)[HEADER]
#+end_example

**** Inline Source Blocks
#+begin_example
src_LANG{BODY}
src_LANG[OPTIONS]{BODY}
#+end_example

*** Line Breaks
A line break consists in =\\SPACE=  pattern at the end of an otherwise
non-empty line.

*** Links
There are 4 major types of links:

- "radio" :: =PRE1 RADIO POST1=
- "angle" :: =<PROTOCOL:PATH>=
- "plain" :: =PRE2 PROTOCOL:PATH2 POST2=
- "regular" :: =[[PATH3]DESCRIPTION]=


=PRE1= and =POST1=, when they exist, are non alphanumeric characters.

=RADIO= is a string matched by some radio target.  It may contain
- entities,
- latex fragments,
- subscript and
- superscript


=PROTOCOL= is a string among ~org-link-types~.

=PATH= can contain any character but
: ], <, > \n

=PRE2=  and  =POST2=,  when  they  exist,  are  non  word  constituent
characters.

=PATH2= can contain any non-whitespace character excepted
: (, ), < >.
It must end  with a word-constituent character,  or any non-whitespace
non-punctuation character followed by =/=.

=DESCRIPTION= is optional but must be enclosed within square brackets.
It can  contain any object found  in a paragraph excepted  a =footnote
reference=f, a  =radio target= and  a =line break=. It  cannot contain
another link either, unless it is a =plain= or =angular= link.

=PATH3= is built according to the following patterns:

#+begin_example
FILENAME           ("file" type)
PROTOCOL:PATH4     ("PROTOCOL" type)
PROTOCOL://PATH4   ("PROTOCOL" type)
id:ID              ("id" type)
#CUSTOM-ID         ("custom-id" type)
(CODEREF)          ("coderef" type)
FUZZY              ("fuzzy" type)
#+end_example

=ID= is constituted of hexadecimal numbers separated with hyphens.

*** Macros
: {{{NAME(ARGUMENTS)}}}

=NAME= must start with  a letter and can be followed  by any number of
alpha-numeric characters, hyphens and underscores.

Values  within =ARGUMENTS=  are  separated  by commas.  Non-separating
commas have to be escaped with a backslash character.

*** Targets and Radio Targets

**** Targets
: <<TARGET>>

=TARGET= cannot  start or end  with a whitespace character.  It cannot
contain any object.

**** Radio Targets
: <<<CONTENTS>>>

=CONTENTS= cannot  start or end  with a whitespace character.  A RADIO
TARGET can contain these objects only:
- text markup,
- entities,
- latex fragments,
- subscript and
- superscript

*** Statistics Cookies
#+begin_example
[PERCENT%]
[NUM1/NUM2]
#+end_example

Valid values are numbers or the empty string.

*** Subscript and Superscript
#+begin_example
CHAR_SCRIPT	"subscript"
CHAR^SCRIPT	"superscript"
#+end_example

=CHAR= is any non-whitespace character.

=SCRIPT=  can  be  =*=  or   an  expression  enclosed  in  parenthesis
(respectively   curly   brackets),    possibly   containing   balanced
parenthesis  (respectively curly  brackets).  It can  also follow  the
pattern:

: SIGN CHARS FINAL

=SIGN= is either a
- plus sign,
- minus sign, or
- empty string


=CHARS= is any number of
- alpha-numeric characters,
- commas,
- backslashes and
- dots, or
- an empty string


=FINAL= is an alpha-numeric character.

There is no white space between =SIGN=, =CHARS= and =FINAL=.

*** Table Cells
: CONTENTS SPACES|

=CONTENTS= can contain any character excepted a vertical bar.

=SPACES= contains any  number of space characters,  including zero. It
can be used to align properly the table.

*** Timestamps
There are seven possible patterns for TIMESTAMPS:

#+begin_example
<%%(SEXP)>                                                     (diary)
<DATE TIME REPEATER-OR-DELAY>                                  (active)
[DATE TIME REPEATER-OR-DELAY]                                  (inactive)
<DATE TIME REPEATER-OR-DELAY>--<DATE TIME REPEATER-OR-DELAY>   (active range)
<DATE TIME-TIME REPEATER-OR-DELAY>                             (active range)
[DATE TIME REPEATER-OR-DELAY]--[DATE TIME REPEATER-OR-DELAY]   (inactive range)
[DATE TIME-TIME REPEATER-OR-DELAY]                             (inactive range)
#+end_example

=SEXP= can contain any character excepted =>= and =\n=.

=DATE= follows the pattern:
: YYYY-MM-DD DAYNAME

=TIME= follows the pattern
: H:MM
H can be one or two digit long and can start with 0.

=REPEATER-OR-DELAY= follows the pattern (no white space):
: MARK VALUE UNIT
=MARK= is:
- =+= (cumulate type),
- =++= (catch-up type) or
- =.+= (restart type) for a repeater, and
- =-= (all type) or
- =--= (first type) for warning delays


=VALUE= is a number.

=UNIT= is a character among
- =h= (hour),
- =d= (day),
- =w= (week),
- =m= (month),
- =y= (year)


There can be two =REPEATER-OR-DELAY= in the timestamp:
- one as a repeater and
- one as a warning delay

*** Text Markup
: PRE MARKER CONTENTS MARKER POST
(no white space)

=PRE= is a
- whitespace character,
- =-=,
- =(=,
- ={=
- ='= or
- ="=
- =beginning-of-line=


=MARKER= is a character among:
- =*= (bold),
- === (verbatim),
- =/= (italic),
- =+= (strike-through),
- =_= (underline),
- =~= (code)


=CONTENTS= is a string following the pattern (no whitespace):
: BORDER BODY BORDER

=BORDER= can be any non-whitespace character.

=BODY= can  contain contain any character  but may not span  over more
than 3 lines.

=CONTENTS= can contain any object encountered in a paragraph when markup is:
- “bold”,
- “italic”,
- “strike-through” or
- “underline”


=POST= is a whitespace character, =EOL= character, or:
: -, ., ,, ;, :, !, ?, ', ), }, [ "

* Org Parse
[[file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/org-9.4/org-element.el::;;; org-element.el  --- Parser  for Org  Syntax -*-  lexical-binding: t;  -*-][~org-element.el~]] implements  a parser  according to  Org's syntax
specification.

** The Syntactic Element
Available =getter='s for the syntactic parts of an element or object:
- ~org-element-type~
- ~org-element-property~
- ~org-element-content~


A syntactically parsed  element or object is represented as  a list of
the following structure:

: (TYPE PROPERTIES CONTENTS)

where

- =TYPE= :: is  a symbol describing the element or  object; it will be
  one element found in one of the variables:
  - ~org-element-all-elements~ or
  - ~org-element-all-objects~.

  It's value can be retrieved with the procedure:
  - ~org-element-type~.

- =PROPERTIES= :: is  a plist of /attributes/ attached  to the element
  or object. All types share the following attributes:
  - =:begin=
  - =:end=
  - =:post-blank=
  - =:parent=

  The  =PROPERTIES= list is retrieved with the procedure:
  - ~org-element-property~

- =CONTENTS=  :: is a list of elements, objects, and raw strings
  contained in the element or object. The value of the =CONTENTS= is
  obtained by means of the procedure:
  - ~org-element-contents~

** The Parse Procedures
- ~org-element-parse-buffer~
- ~org-element-parse-secondary-string~
- ~org-element-at-point~
- ~org-element-context~

*** org-element-parse-buffer &optional granularity visible-only
This  procedure  recursively  parses  Org syntax  inside  the  current
buffer,  taking into  account
- region,
- narrowing, and
- visibility.

The buffer's structure is returned.

=GRANULARITY= determines  the depth of  the recursion. It  is optional
and can be set to one of the following symbols:

- =headline= :: parse headlines only
- =greater-element= :: only recurse  into headlines and sections (only
  parse top-level elements)
- =element= :: parse everything but objects and plain text.
- =object= :: parse the complete buffer (the default)


=VISIBLE-ONLY= non-=nil=, do not parse contents of hidden elements.

*** org-element-parse-secondary-string string restriction &optional parent
This procedure  recursively parses objects  within a given  string and
returns its structure.

*** org-element-at-point

*** org-element-context &optional element

	returns smallest element or object around point
	return value is a list (TYPE PROPS)
	possible types are defined in 'org-element-all-elements and
				      'org-element-all-objects
	properties depend on element or object type
		always include:
			:begin :end :parent :post-blank

*** org-element-at-point ()
Determine the closest element around point.

The return value is a list of the form:
: (TYPE PROPERTIES)
where

- =TYPE= :: is the type of the element;

- =PROPERTIES=   ::  is  a  plist of  properties  associaged with  the
  element;  all elements contain at least the following properties:

  - =:begin=
  - =:end=
  - =:post-blank=

*** org-element-context (&optional element)
Parse and obtain the smallest element or object containing point.

The return value is a list of the form:
: (TYPE PROPERTIES)

- =TYPE= :: the type of the element or object found

- =PROPERTIES= :: a plist of properties associated with the found
  element or object.

*** Greater Elements
 For each greater  element type, define a parser and  an interpreter.

 A parser  returns the element or  object as the list  described above.
 Parsing    functions    must    follow    the    naming    convention:
 org-element-TYPE-parser,  where TYPE  is  greater  element's type,  as
 defined in =org-element-greater-elements=.

 An interpreter accepts  two arguments: the list  representation of the
 element or object, and its contents.  The latter may be nil, depending
 on the  element or object  considered. It returns the  appropriate Org
 syntax, as a string. Similarly, interpreting functions must follow the
 naming convention: =org-element-TYPE-interpreter=.

 With the  exception of `headline'  and `item' types,  greater elements
 cannot contain other greater elements of their own type.
