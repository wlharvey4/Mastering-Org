* Glossary
  - ~#+KEY:~ :: *In-buffer setting* ==> See [[https://orgmode.org/org.html#In_002dbuffer-settings][In-Buffer Settings]]

    /In-buffer settings/ start with ‘#+’, followed by a keyword, a colon, and then a word for each
                setting.  There are dozens upon dozens of these.  To see an alphabetical list of
                (most) of them, look in the index under ~#~.  Unfortunately, not all are in the
                index.

    ==> [[https://orgmode.org/org.html#Main-Index][#-Index]]

    You will see numerous /in-buffer settings/ scattered throughout the manual and tutorials, but
                they are not introduced prior, so they can be somewhat cryptic at first.

    In addition to /in-buffer settings/, there is another similar construct called *OPTIONS*
                (~#+OPTIONS:~) which is used to set in-buffer settings as well (primarily for
                export settings).  /Options/ uses a large set of short, abbreviated key-value pairs
                ([[https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-settings.html#Export-settings][Options]]).  Unfortunately, the manual uses the term 'options' for in-buffer
                settings as well as ~OPTIONS~.

  - Agenda :: Org can select items based on various criteria and display them in a separate
              buffer. Six different view types are provided, one of which is ~agenda~: like a
              calendar and shows information for specific dates.  The extracted information is
              displayed in a special /agenda/ buffer.

    + Agenda Files :: The information to be shown is normally collected from all /agenda/
                      files, the files listed in the variable ~org-agenda-files~.  If a
                      directory is part of this list, all files with the extension ~.org~
                      in this directory will be part of the list.  Add and remove files
                      from this list using ~C-c [~ and ~C-c ]~.

    + Agenda Dispatcher :: The views are created through a dispatcher, which should be bound to a
         global key—for example ~C-c a~.  After pressing ~C-c a~, an additional letter is required
         to execute a command.  ~a~ produces a calendar-like /agenda/ view.  ~t~ produces a list of
         ~TODO~ items.  ~m~ produces headlines matching a ~TAGS~ expression.  There are others as
         well.  See [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-dispatcher.html#Agenda-dispatcher][Agender Dispatcher]].

  - Capture :: *Capture* lets you quickly store notes with little interruption of your work
               flow [fn:remember].  Capturing is controlled by ~org-remember.el~.

    + Set Up Capture :: set a default target file for notes, and define a global key for
      capturing new material.
      : (setq org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/notes.org"))
      : (define-key global-map "\C-cc" 'org-capture)

    + Use Capture<<capture>> :: ~C-c c~ is the basic command ~(org-capture)~; it has some alternates:

      + ~(org-capture &optional ARG)~ :: ~C-c c~; with a prefix ~C-u C-c c~, find the last stored
           capture; with two prefixes ~C-u C-u C-c c~, visit the last stored capture in a separate
           buffer.  Can also jump to the bookmark ~org-capture-last-stored~.  With a zero prefix
           ~C-0 C-c c~, insert the capture at point.
      + ~(org-capture-finalize)~ :: ~C-c C-c~
      + ~(org-capture-refile)~ :: ~C-c C-w~
      + ~(org-capture-kill)~ :: ~C-c C-k~

[fn:remember] Org’s method for capturing new items is heavily inspired by John Wiegley excellent
~remember.el~ package.]


  - Capture Templates :: You can use templates for different types of capture items, and for
       different target locations.  Because the code is quite complex, you should create new
       templates using the customize interface, using ~C-c c C~.

    See [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture-templates.html#Capture-templates][Capture Templates]] for full details

  - Category :: The /category/ is a broad label assigned to each agenda item.  By default, the
                category is simply derived from the file name.  You can specify a file-wide
                category using the in-buffer setting ~#+CATEGORY: Value~ outside of a heading.  A
                different in-buffer category can be added to a heading, or you can give each entry
                its own category with the ~:CATEGORY:Value~ property.  The AGENDA VIEW uses the
                category as the first item in a line.

  - Drawer (~:DRAWERNAME:~) :: A place to hide content and settings.  A drawer name is delimited by
       colons.  A drawer must be terminated by an ~:END:~ keyword.  Anything can go inside a
       /drawer/ except a heading and another drawer.

       ~C-c C-x d~ :: ~(org-insert-drawer &optional ARG DRAWER)~; interactively insert a drawer at
       point; with an active region, put the region inside a drawer; with a prefix argument, insert
       a /property drawer/ (see [[property-drawer][Property Drawer]]; see [[logbook-drawer][Logbook Drawer]]).

  - Footnote (~[fn:m]~) :: A footnote is started by a /footnote marker/ in square brackets in
       column 0, no indentation allowed. It ends at the next footnote definition, headline, or
       after two consecutive empty lines.  The /footnote reference/ is simply the /marker/ in
       square brackets, inside text.  Markers always start with ~fn:~.

       Footnote Example:
       : The Org homepage[fn:1] now looks a lot better than it used to.
       : ...
       : [fn:1] The link is: https://orgmode.org

       Footnotes may also be *named footnotes*: ~[fn:name]~ (name must be unique).

       Footnames may also be *inline footnotes*: ~[fn:inline definition]~.  This is basically a
       LaTeX-like anonymous footnote where the definition is given directly at the reference point.

       Finally, a hybrid footnote with both a label and an in-line definition, allowing further
       references to the same footnote.
       : [fn:name:a definition]

  - Keyword :: A ~TODO~ state, e.g. one of: ~TODO~ ~DONE~.  These are the default states.  You can
               customize the states using ~TODO~ kewords, e.g., ~TODO~ -> ~FEEDBACK~ -> ~VERIFY~ ->
               ~DONE~ | ~VERIFIED~.

               Org offers many facets to this functionality, all of which is configurable.  See
               [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Workflow-states.html#Workflow-states][TODO Keywords]] and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/TODO-extensions.html#TODO-extensions][Extended TODO Keywords]].

  - Hyperlink :: A link to another place in a file, another file, Usenet article, email, etc.
                 Links are categorized as /internal/ or /external/.  [[info:org#Handling%20links][Handling Links]]

    + Link Format :: =[[link][Description] ]= where [Description] is optional

    + ~C-c l~ :: ~(org-store-link)~ store a link to the current location (because this is a /global
                 command/, you must create a key binding yourself.

      - Org buffers :: cursor on ~<<target>>~; cursor on headline; ~:CUSTOM_ID:~ property;

      - Email News :: link will point to current thing

      - Web browsers :: EWW, W3, W3M link will point to current URL, with page title as description

      - Files :: link will point to the file, with a search string pointing to the contents of the
                 current line; can create custom functions to select the search string.

    + ~C-c C-l~ :: create or edit a link; all links stored during the current session are part of
                   the history; can access them with ~<UP>~ and ~<DOWN>~ (or ~M-p/n~).

    + ~C-u C-c C-l~ :: a link to a file will be inserted; may use file name completion to select
                       the name of the file.  (Force an absolute path with 2 ~C-u~ prefixes).

    + ~C-c C-o~ or ~<RET>~:: follow a link; execute a command in a shell link; run an internal
      search; create a TAGS view; compiles an agenda for date; visit an external file; run an
      external program (based on file extension); to visit without running, call with a ~C-u~
      prefix;

    + ~C-c C-x C-v~ :: ~(org-toggle-inline-image)~

    + ~C-c &~ :: return to calling position (using Org's mark ring)

    + ~C-c %~ :: Push current position onto the mark ring to make for an easy return.

    + ~C-c C-x C-n/p~ :: next/previous link

    + Internal Link :: a link that does not look like a URL is considered an /internal link/

      * custom-id link :: ~[[#my-custom-id] ]~, which links to the entry with the
                          ~:CUSTOM_ID:my-custom-id~ property, which must be unique in the file.

      * text link :: ~[[My Target][description] ]~ performs a text search in the current file.  The
                     preferred match is to a /dedicated target/, which is the text in double angle
                     brackets: ~<<My Target>>~.  If there is no dedicated target, then there will
                     be a search for an exact name: ~#+NAME: My Target~, placed just before the
                     element it refers to.  Note that you must use the ~#+CAPTION:~ keyword.
                     Finally, there will be a search for a headline that is exactly the link text,
                     plus optionally ~TODO~ and tags.

                     Use in-buffer completion to insert a link targeting a headline: ~* abc M-<TAB>~

    + External Link :: Link to a file, website, Usenet, or email message, plus more.  An external
                       link is a URL-like locator, starting with a short identifying string and a
                       colon.  See 4.3 External Links for a list of examples.

      - If the description is a file name or URL that points to an image, HTML export will inline
        the image as a clickable link; if there is no description, that image will be inlined
        into the exported HTML file.

  - Outline :: Org is implemented on top of Outline mode.  Outlines allow a document to be
               organized in a hierarchical structure.  An overview of this structure is achieved by
               *folding* (/hiding/) large parts of the document to show only the general document
               structure and the parts currently being worked on.

    + ~<TAB>~ :: ~(org-cycle &optional ARG)~

         This function has many different semantic meanings depending upon its context and how many
         arguments precede it.

         When point is at the beginning of a headline, rotate the subtree through 3 different
                 states (called /local cycling/): FOLDED -> CHILDREN -> SUBTREE

         When called with a single prefix ~C-u~, rotate the buffer through 3 states (/global
         cycling/): OVERVIEW -> CONTENTS -> SHOW ALL

         When called with two prefix arguments (~C-u C-u~) switch to the startup visibility.

         When called with three prefix arguments (~C-u C-u C-u~) show the entire buffer, including
                 drawers.

    + ~<S-TAB>~ :: ~(org-shifttab & optional ARG)~

         Global visibility cycling (unless within a table; then ~(org-table-previous-field)~;

  - PROPERTY (~:PROPERTY:value~) :: A property is a key-value pair associated with an entry.
       Depending on how one is set up, it can be associated with a single entry or with a tree, or
       with every entry in a file.  Like a tag, a property is delimited on both ends by colons, so
       this is a property: ~:A_PROPERTY:Some value~.  The key portion is case-insensitive.

  - Property Drawer (~:PROPERTIES:...:END:~)<<property-drawer>> :: A drawer called ~:PROPERTIES:~,
       inside of which are kept various individual properties.

       ~C-u C-c C-x d~ :: (org-insert-drawer &optional ARG); insert a property drawer below the
       current headline.

  - Logbook Drawer (~:LOGBOOK:...:END:~)<<logbook-drawer>> :: A special drawer to store /state change notes/ and /clock
       times/.  See [[state-change][State Change]].

  - REFILE :: Refile or copy /captured/ data (see [[capture][Capture]])

    + ~(org-refile)~ :: ~C-c C-w~ Refile the entry or region at point. This command
                        offers possible locations for refiling the entry and lets you
                        select one with completion.  By default, all level 1 headlines in
                        the current buffer are considered to be targets, but you can have
                        more complex definitions across a number of files using variable
                        ~org-refile-targets~.  This command utilizes many different
                        prefix patterns to alter the semantics.  See [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Refile-and-copy.html#Refile-and-copy][Refile and Copy]].

    + ~(org-copy)~ :: Copying works like refiling, except that the original note is not
                      deleted.

  - ~TODO~ STATE CHANGE<<state-change>> :: keep track of when a state change occurred and maybe
       take a note about this change.  You can either record just a timestamp, or a time-stamped
       note for a change.  These records will be inserted after the headline as an itemized list,
       newest first.

       To keep the notes hidden and out of the way, place them into a special drawer called
       ~:LOGBOOK:~.  [[logbook-drawer][Logbook Drawer]]   Globally customize the variable ~org-log-into-drawer~ to get
       this behavior.  You can also set a property called ~:LOG-INTO-DRAWER:DrawerName~.

       ~C-c C-z~ :: ~(org-add-note)~  add a note to the current entry

       To time-stamp when a ~TODO~ is changed to ~DONE~, set the variable ~org-log-done~ to the
       value of ~time~, or use the in-buffer setting of ~#+STARTUP: logdone~.  A line ~CLOSED:
       [timestamp]~ will be inserted.

       To also record a note when cycling a ~TODO~ to ~DONE~, set the variable ~org-log-done~ to
       the value ~note~ instead, or add an in-buffer setting of ~#+STARTUP: lognotedone~.

       To customize special logging for other state changes, see [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-TODO-state-changes.html#Tracking-TODO-state-changes][Tracking TODO State Changes]]

  - TAG (~:tag:~) :: Words delimited by colons (~:~) added to the end of a headline to give extra
                     context.
    ==> See [[https://orgmode.org/org.html#Tags][Tags]].  They can be stacked (called a /list of tags/): ~:tag1:tag2:~

    Tags are normal words containing /letters/, /numbers/, /underscores (_)/, and /ampersands (@)/.

    + ~C-c C-c~ :: activate changes to in-buffer settings

  - Clocking Time :: Clock the time you spend on a specific task in a project.  When you start
                     working on an item, start the clock.  When you stop, or when you mark ~DONE~,
                     stop the clock.  The corresponding time interval is recorded.  Org will also
                     comput the total time spent on each subtree of a project.  [[info:org#Clocking%20commands][Clocking Commands]]

                     Consider creating global key bindings for ~(org-clock-out)~ and
                     ~(org-clock-in-last)~ 

    + ~C-c C-x C-i~ :: ~(org-clock-in)~ --- inserts the ~CLOCK~ keyword together with a timestamp.

      * ~C-u C-c C-x C-i~ :: select from a list of recently clocked tasks.

      * ~C-u C-u C-c C-x C-i~ :: clock into the task at point and mark it as the /default task/; the
           /default task/ will then be available with ~d~ when selecting a clocking task.

      * ~C-u C-u C-u C-c C-x C-i~ :: force continuous clocking by starting the clock when the last
           clock is stopped.

    + ~C-c C-x C-o~ :: ~(org-clock-out)~ --- stop the clock; inserts another timestamp at the same
                       location where the clock was started.  Computes the resulting time and
                       inserts it.  Have the option of inserting an additional note using the
                       variable: ~org-log-note-clock-out~, or ~#+STARTUP: lognoteclock-out~.

    + ~C-c C-x C-x~ :: ~(org-clock-in-last)~ --- reclock the last clocked task.

      * ~C-u C-c C-x C-x~ :: select the task from the clock history

      * ~C-u C-u C-c C-x C-x~ :: force continuous clocking by starting the clock when the last clock
           is stopped.

    + ~C-c C-x C-e~ :: ~(org-clock-modify-effort-estimate)~

    + ~C-c C-c~ or ~C-c C-y~ :: ~(org-evaluate-time-range)~

    + ~C-S-<up/down>~ :: ~(org-clock-timestamps-up/down)~ --- both timestamps; clock duration
         remains the same

    + ~S-M-<up/down>~ :: ~(org-timestamp-up/down)~ --- timestamp at point, and next or previous

    + ~C-c C-t~ :: ~(org-todo)~ --- changes ~TODO~ to ~DONE~ and stops clock

    + ~C-c C-x C-q~ :: ~(org-clock-cancel)~

    + ~C-c C-x C-j~ :: ~(org-clock-goto)~ --- jumpt to headline of currently clocked-in task

      * ~C-u C-c C-x C-j~ :: select the target task from a list of recently clocked tasks

    + ~C-c C-x C-d~ :: ~(org-clock-display)~ --- display time summaries for each subtree in the
                       current buffer.

    + ~l~ :: in the agenda, ~l~ key shows which tasks have been worked on or closed in a day
